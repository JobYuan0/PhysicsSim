Simulate electric fields by placing point charges in the screen. The saturation of a colour represents the magnitude of an electric field at a point. The colour representing the hue angle corresponding with a colour wheel.

As an example, a positive and negative are given below. The positive charge emanates colours outwards and the negative does the reverse.

In addition, the dipole moment can be demonstrated by placing opposite charges closer together.
